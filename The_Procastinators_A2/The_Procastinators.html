								<p>I was born profoundly deaf, meaning I was born without the ability to hear (which was in both ears). However, I was lucky enough to receive surgery at a very young age, for cochlear implants - as a result, I wear hearing aids and have been for the majority of my life. My parents are from Singapore and Malaysia, but I was born in Australia. Therefore I am only fluent in English, however I did learn Japanese throughout the entirety of high school. I went to Westbourne Grammar School for primary school, before studying at Mount St. Joseph Girls’ College, where I completed high school. In my spare time, I enjoy playing a wide range of online games with my friends. I love playing first person shooter games, in particular, I am a big fan of the game 'Valorant'. My first proper encounter with IT was in Year 10, when I chose to study IT as one of my electives. In particular, I had always enjoyed learning the design aspect of IT, such as web development and the programming aspect as well. I always thought the idea of working on something and seeing the final result was very satisfying and I liked that feeling of accomplishment, hence why those aspects of IT always stood out to my liking. There was a particular person who sparked my interest, this person was my IT teacher throughout Year 10 to Year 12. She played a significant role in my interest in IT and she was also someone who believed in me when I had a moment of doubt about whether IT was the right career pathway for me. Through her, I learned how to use a wide range of software programs and because she made learning about IT fun, it allowed my passion for the subject to continue to grow. 
								</p>
								<h3><b><u>Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<i><b>16 personality test:</b></i> <b><u>Adventurer</u></b>
								<p>Based on these results, I am more of an introvert, observant, I follow my feelings more than my thinking, I am more prospecting rather than judging, and I am turbulent. Introverts have been known to gain energy from being alone and prefer to be in a more quiet environment to recharge. Observant (or Sensing) behaviour refers to gathering facts from relying on their senses such as sight, touch and hearing, they gather these facts from their immediate environment and surroundings. Lastly, I am considered a perceiver which is more focused on the organisational aspect in the environment. In my case, I am someone who prefers to be more flexible and not as organised in terms of keeping a tight schedule or list of things I have to do.
								</p>
								<i><b>Learner Style:</b></i> <b><u>Reflector</u></b>
								<p>People who prefer to observe a situation by standing back and watching rather than jumping into it belong to this learning style. They also prefer to look at things from many angles, gathering information from both first-hand and third-party sources. They would rather think about what is going on and take in what they are seeing in order to arrive at an acceptable judgement. Reflectors are also cautious, and they feel compelled to analyse all possible outcomes before committing to a course of action. Reflectors are said to learn best when they are given time to think before acting, as well as time to explore the circumstance. These learners like to work with the group rather than take the leadership role. </p>
								<i><b>Leadership test:</b></i> <b><u>Front-Line</u></b>
								<p>The front-line leaders are people who are hands-on and highly engaged with their team members, focusing heavily on knowing how to connect with them. It is also highlighted that front-line leaders aim to empower those around them, with the goal of helping them to achieve their best. These types of leaders are also known to display empathy and demonstrate authenticity for their team members. By being able to be authentic, they open and share themselves to others which can help with engaging team members to share the same vision the leader has.

								<h2>NAME: Appukutti Arachchige Dona Sudari Kawya</h2>
								<h2>STUDENT ID: s3943932</h2>
								<h2>STUDENT EMIAL: s3943932@student.rmit.edu.au</h2>
								<a class="image"><img src="images/sudari.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="300" data-position="centre centre"/></a>
                                <p>I was born on November 12, 2003 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I was born into a family of four. Who are my mum (who loves bossing the whole family around and security is the boss of all of us), My dad ( the only one who obeys my mum willingly), My older sister (the one one who thinks she’s the most intelligent one) and me (the one whos obsessed with food). My family made a massive decision to move to Australia due to the poor education and the security and some financial situations in Sri Lanka. I am personally a major music fan. As of now I have listened to more than 7 different languages worth of songs. I got into music because of my family background. My dad and sister used to sing in various different musical shows back in Sri Lanka. For me, The Internet provides individuals throughout the world with limitless opportunities. When the door to unlimited possibilities opens, people try to be creative in order to make their own imaginations come true, which may have either a beneficial or bad effect on the audience. It may be an unusual curiosity, but I find the negative component of this fascinating since it helps me to understand the negative aspects so that I may take steps to avoid them from occurring. This is why I'm considering pursuing a career as a cyber security engineer, since I want to safeguard Internet users from having a negative internet experience. Since I discovered this field, I've been learning about the dark web browser, which piqued my interest. This browser fascinates me because of the wide range of personalities that exist inside it. This web browser is not accessible to everyone, and it should not be. This is due to the browser's limitless capabilities and potential, as well as the fact that everything is done anonymously. Nobody knows who made what, who shared it, or even who is looking at it. That is the enthralling aspect of information technology.
								</p>
								<h3><b><u>Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Commander personality</u></b>
								<p>Group environments are almost a natural environment for persons with the Commander personality type. Commanders are praised for their efficiency and straightforward communication, their leadership is recognised, and their ability to simply get things done. However, certain situations are more suited for Commanders than others - these characteristics all lead to a management or executive position, making any position of relative weakness particularly unattractive.</p>
								<b><i>Leadership test:</i><u>Metamodern</u></b>
								<p>This leadership focuses on having a positive working environment which focuses on psychological safety. Metamodern leaders can gain engagement, inclusiveness and innovation from their group members as they communicate properly making a safe environment for the members to share each idea. </p>
								<b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Auditory/ Tactile learner</u></b>
								<p>This learning style focuses on hearing, listening and by physically doing the activity in order to learn.  Auditory learning methods make me remember things by listening to a lot of information such as either reading out loud when reading a book or listening to the teacher clearly when learning. Tactile learning style allows me to learn things by either physically doing it or touching. This learning style likes to explore and build things together in order to learn.

								<h2>NAME: Nafisa Rahman</h2>
								<h2>STUDENT ID: s3882020</h2>

								<p>I was born and brought up in Bangladesh and recently moved to Australia a few weeks ago. I completed my high school back in 2020 and then decided to study in Australia. Ever since I remember, we had a family tradition of travelling to a new place every 1-2 years which really grew my appreciation for various languages and different cultures. That’s where my love for picking up new languages came from as I always wanted to be a polyglot. I currently speak 4 languages (Bengali, Hindi, English, Japanese) and hope to add more to my list in the future. My South Asian heritage also meant we were always a household that was deeply appreciative of dance and various forms of music, which is why I naturally enjoy them as well. 
									The side of IT that I am most interested in would be User experience designing and Web development, as they are connected to one another. Whenever I am visiting a site or using an app, I immediately dismiss it and stop using it altogether if the design isn’t easy on the eye or if it isn’t comfortable to use. Regardless of how innovative or informative the app or website is, I am sure many people switch to different sites due to the same reasons as I do. It always made me wonder if I was the one in the driver’s seat, what touches I would put to negate this negative response from myself.
									 In my first year at Melbourne University, I did a subject that required us to design wireframes for a game and later create a prototype for it before moving to the actual programming part. I realised I enjoyed that more than any of my subjects I was doing at that time. I was initially doing computer science but after this I was set on doing IT as it was more relevant towards what I was interested in. But unfortunately, they did not offer a bachelor’s degree for information technology. I did not wait any further and decided to transfer to RMIT as they are known to have a great student experience for IT and computer science departments. Throughout my time here I hope to learn skills that would help me with my future job prospects and help me grow as a person.
									</p>
									<h3><b><u>	Tests:</u></b></h3>
									<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Campaigner</u></b>
									<p>Campaigners are known as the true free spirits. Because I am dedicated to developing my connections and social life, according to my MBTI, I feel it would be beneficial for me to build a friendly dynamic with individuals when working in a group situation. Some of my personality qualities indicate that I am insightful and a good communicator. These characteristics will help me communicate challenges and progress to others while I'm working with them. However, I am also disorganised and restless, which I have always been. When I'm attempting to meet deadlines, these things tend to bother me.
									</p>
									<b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Visual</u></b>
									<p>I am mostly a visual learner as shown by my result, vision being at 40% followed by auditory at 35% and tactile at 25%. I tend to learn by reading or seeing pictures. I also mostly understand and remember things by sight. Furthermore, I have difficulty with spoken directions, and I am easily distracted by sounds.
									</p>
									<b><i>Big Five Personality:</i><u>Extroversion, Emotional, Agreebleness, Conscientiousness, imagination</u></b>
									<p>Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality. My Factor II is labelled as Emotional Stability. Along with that my Factor III is labelled as Agreeableness. A person that is high in agreeableness is said to be friendly and optimistic. My Factor IV is labelled as Conscientiousness followed by my Factor V which is Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience.</p>

								<h2>STUDENT EMAIL: s3884224@student.rmit.edu.au</h2>
								<a class="images"><img src="images/amulya.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a>
								<p>I was born and brought up in India. Apart from English, I can speak Telugu and Hindi. I graduated high school from FIITJEE junior college in 2020. I love playing basketball and have participated in many competitions. I love to travel a lot. Recently, I travelled to Tasmania, and it was one of the best places I have ever been. Every day in Tasmania was memorable and exciting. I had the best hiking experience at Cradle mountain. I desire to travel more and more in the future and learn about different people and their cultures. During my leisure time, I watch movies in various languages; English, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. I even used to volunteer at Blue Cross, Hyderabad; it's an organisation for the welfare of animals. I took some time to decide what to study and did a lot of research. I finally decided to study Information Technology as it fascinated me. I believe it teaches many new things in this era of technology. I want to study Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning and how to apply Artificial Intelligence in different fields like healthcare, retail, sports activities, and security and surveillance.</p>
								<h3><b><u> Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Mediator</u></b>
								<p>Mediators have a vibrant, inventive, and imaginative character. They can create all sorts of stories and conversations in their mind and are curious and like to find answers. Being creative and innovative is one of the traits of a mediator. These personalities are ethical and kind and always bring positive energy to the room. Mediators try to understand people and their emotions. When someone shares their personal story, mediators will always be attentive and listen to them, and sometimes comfort them. Sometimes, they want to isolate themselves and be alone, and this will also help them find their inner self and cope with emotions and find their purpose.
								</p>
                                <b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Auditory</u></b>
								<p>Being an auditory listener means they understand and memorise information they have heard. They can soak up information they hear in a lecture or a presentation. Having an aural personality, I listen to my teammates and take observations and remember every detail. 
								</p>
								<b><i>Big Five Personality:</i><u>Agreeableness, Extraversion, Openness, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness  </u></b>
								<p>Based on the results, I'm open-minded to new and unique ideas and use my imagination to create an exciting world. It's easy for me to work in a team as I get along with others and bring positive energy. Though I'm neurotic, I try to give my best and provide substantial results. Being a neurotic also means I'm self-aware and take fewer risks. </p>

								<a class="images"><img src="images/ethan.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a>
								<p>I am a 20 year old Australian, I went to a Christian school all the way from prep to year 12. I only speak one language, it being English. I have travelled to the USA four times in my life. First trip was when I was only five and the last was when I was 17. This led to many people in my school believing I was in fact American, I’m not. Also I’ve been to all the mainland states, 48/50 in total.  My primary interest for studying IT is to one day be able to produce a product that others will like. My interest in IT began with video games when I was a child. Since I was two years old, I've been playing video games, the first of which was HALO. I've always wanted to be a part of something legendary, like the Halo series, since then. I took some IT electives in high school and built a mediocre bullet hell game, but it was a lot of fun. Now that I'm enrolled in a University IT programme, I can see that this is exactly what I want to accomplish with my life.
								</p>
								<h3><b><u>Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Campaigner</u></b>
								<p>which according to them I am a “true free spirit – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded” person. I do resonate with this as I feel that I can work well with groups. I can make friends easily as I am a sociable person. The results show that I am a person who will make “longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people . My personality allows me to mesh well with all kinds of people and let others take the lead and I can boost them.</p>
								<b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Visual learner</u></b>
								<p>This means that I learn more so by reading or looking at the content rather than hearing or doing it. I noticed this a lot during School as the way I would study is to write summaries and just read them over and over. I think it will influence my behaviour in a team in a limiting way. What I mean is that if I’m in a group of people that are all tactile learners I would struggle as they would want to do and learn the work in a way that doesn’t mesh well with me. Resulting in a smaller pool of people I can work efficiently with. I will take this into account by choosing my group carefully and being aware of the different learning styles.</p>
								<b><i>Creativity test:</i><u>Work in progress</u></b>
								<p>This category which for them is the middle point. I understand why I wasn’t put higher in the scale because if I’m being honest with myself, I would prefer to implement good ideas then come up with them. Not to say I’m not creative at all, as I do come up with things on my own etc. These results would influence my behaviour in a team by putting me down on the chain of command I feel, in the sense that the creative people hand out their ideas, or work, and I will be the one implementing them into our systems. This would mean I would have to take more creative people onboard in my groups to outweigh the balance of the group.</p>

									<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

									<h2><u>Jasmine</u></h2>
									<b><u>Ideal Job:</u>  Game Producer - UI/UX</b>
									<p>This position, which is provided by Riot Games, is focused on the vision of their product, a first person shooter game, ‘Valorant’. Riot Games expects the Game Producer II to be responsible for assisting in ensuring that Riot delivers content and features of high quality and satisfaction for their consumers. Other tasks the Game Producer II will have include being able to track progress with the gaming experience of their players kept in mind, focusing on organising priorities and goals, as well as delivering upcoming features and content. The Game Producer II is also required to work together with other positions in the company such as artists, engineers, and designers in order to present a quality product and experience for Riot’s players. 
									</p>
									<p>As a Riot Games consumer, particularly with their game, ‘Valorant’, I have always considered potentially working at Riot Games. What I find so appealing about this position is how heavily involved the Game Producer II is in the production of the game and the future developments that are yet to come. I find that it would be very rewarding to be working on the newest updates and seeing it in the game itself. Another aspect that I like about this position is the opportunity to work with artists and designers, which is something I have always wanted to do as I love seeing how a design can turn into something big such as a new character or a new map in the game.
									</p>
									<b>Skills needed:</b>
									<p>Skills a Game Producer II must have are the ability to collaborate and communicate with their team members, as it is crucial for them to work together to deliver content. It is also important that Game Producers have organisational skills, as their position is heavily focused on meeting deadlines and working on a time constraint. Game Producers would also need the skills to observe and have an extensive knowledge about the game industry, as well as being able to keep up to date with what consumers are having issues with or would like to see in the future. They are also expected to have familiarity with working with user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), and having an understanding of how it affects consumers, which also correlates with the skill of being able to understand what consumers want and how they can improve the product for a better experience. </p>
									<p>A Game Producer II must have qualifications and experience that show a deep understanding and knowledge of games. In particular, Game Producers require at least three years of experience as a game producer, product manager, or development manager, as well as experience with shipping games or game content in a production role, which means that they have managed to take a game or content to market. Riot Games has also expressed desirable qualifications and experience for their ideal candidate. The company desires someone who has had experience with a live game service, which means that the desired person is familiar with updating games and keeping to deadlines for new developments. Riot Games also desires a person who has experience working with distributed development and outsourcing. This includes working collaboratively towards the outcome of the product, which in this case would be the game ‘Valorant’. It also includes being able to work with third party teams to produce content for the game. The last desired qualification Riot Games seeks for is experience with “game content pipelines” which refers to the process of building a game from stage to stage, from the concept to the completion. 
									</p>

									<h2><u>Sudari</u></h2>
									<b><u>Ideal Job:</u>  Cybersecurity Engineer</b>

Which majors in Discrete math, cryptography, coding for cyber communication, applied analysis, machine learning, networking, cloud networking, IT infrastructure and security. After completing these 2 years of masters I will be qualified academically to get into the job field in cybersecurity engineering. However, gaining industry experience is equally as important as gaining academic knowledge. Going into career expos from RMIT and gaining contacts from industry specialists can get me experience required for the final job. </p>

									<h2><u>Nafisa</u></h2>
									<b><u>Ideal Job:</u>Junior UX/UI Designer</b>
									<p>I would like to apply for the junior UI/UX designer position at the blue rocks. I have always wanted to work with UX designing as that’s what I have been most inclined to since a long time. I believe I can build on the skills slowly but surely to be a viable candidate for this position. Some of my responsibilities for this position includes joining the Product Team and helping with the product design-related efforts, including user research, prototyping, testing, and iterating on appealing and consistent UX for our products. 
									</p>
									<b>Experience required:</b>
									<p>For carrying out the above tasks, the skills I would need skill sets. I would require

My design portfolio is still very much barren unfortunately, which I plan to work on throughout my time at university along with my other assessments. By the end of it, I hope to have a strong portfolio that shows my creativity and my keen eye for design.

							<h2>Industry data</h2>
							<b>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </b>
							<p>Four out of five of the group members’ ideal jobs were not listed in the data reports provided by Burning Glass (referring to the exact title of their jobs), therefore further research was implemented to find out the most in demand jobs based on the group’s chosen jobs. Research included several reports from different business analytics sources and also articles that highlighted the chosen ideal jobs in recent years, to stay true to its current demand rate. Presented below are the job titles of the group’s ideal jobs:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Jasmine: Game Producer II (UI/UX)</li>
								<li>Sudari: Cybersecurity Engineering</li>
								<li>Nafisa: Junior UI/UX Designer</li>
								<li>Amulya: Machine Learning Engineer</li>
								<li>Ethan: Game Programmer</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Also, the following is the ranking of the group’s chosen ideal jobs based on both Burning Glass reports and further research made:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Cybersecurity Engineering</li>
								<li>Machine Learning Engineer</li>
								<li>Junior UI/UX Designer</li>
								<li>Game Programmer</li>
								<li>Game Producer II (UI/UX)</li>
							</ol>
							<p>According to many experts, Sudari’s chosen ideal job of ‘Cybersecurity Engineering’ is the highest ranking out of the five group members. In recent years, cybersecurity has been known to become one of the most emerging technology jobs and placed in the top ten most sought after technology jobs in many lists and articles. It is also believed that cybersecurity will only continue to grow from now as a highly demanded job from employers. The Australian Government has presented a report on “Australia’s Tech Future” and highlights cybersecurity as its own key section of the report, emphasising the importance of cybersecurity and how the government aims to work towards cybersecurity. This shows the high importance of Sudari’s ideal job, therefore ranking it first out of the five group members.
							</p>
							<p>The next ideal job in the ranking would be Amulya’s, who aims to become a ‘Machine Learning Engineer’. Her ideal position has been presented with interest in several reports for most in demand jobs. There is a high demand for people who possess machine learning skills, but currently there are not many people who do, therefore the demand for them is a lot higher as well. Machine learning is said to be changing rapidly over the past few years and therefore, has become a job that is in high demand with employers as companies are seeking for such employees. Indeed announced Machine Learning Engineers as the top job of 2019, which can provide a clear prediction of how machine learning will grow and become more crucial in the future. 
							</p>
							<p>According to LinkedIn’s ‘Most in Demand Jobs in Technology’ for 2021, ‘User Experience Professionals’ places at 13th place out of the 15 highest demanding jobs. Therefore, this ranks Nafisa’s ideal job of ‘Junior UI/UX Designer’ as third out of the five ideal jobs. This particular job ranks out of all professions and fields, meaning that it is a job that can contribute to many different companies regardless of the field they specialise in. The job title, “UX Designer” does place 20th out of 25 of the most in demand jobs, according to the Burning Glass 2017 report. However, compared to the first two jobs in the group’s ranking, it is not as frequently in demand in recent years.  
							</p>
							<p>Ethan’s ideal job as a ‘Game Programmer’  would rank next out of the five group members’ ideal jobs. The general title of ‘Programmers’ has been known to always be in demand for several years. However, Ethan’s ideal job ‘Game Programmer’ is more niche, catering to the game development industry. Therefore, compared to the rest of the group’s ideal jobs, Ethan’s job would not rank as high. This is also due to the particular title of ‘Game Programmer’ not being as explicitly stated as a “need to be fulfilled as soon as possible” job position. Compared to Jasmine’s ideal job which is also in the same industry, Ethan’s would rank higher as programmers are more desired in the game development industry compared to Jasmine’s ideal job title, ‘Game Producer II (UI/UX) - therefore, Ethan’s would be ranked as fourth in the rankings.
							</p>
							<p>Although Jasmine’s ideal job, ‘Game Producer (UI/UX)’ could be deemed slightly similar to Nafisa’s ideal job, it is also very different as it is not purely focused on user interface and user experience. Similarly to Ethan’s ideal job, Jasmine’s ideal job caters to the game development industry. Therefore, it is expected that the general demand rate is not as high as any of the other group members. When seeking the demand rate, the title “Game Producer” does not show up frequently, and in honesty, is quite sparse and niche compared to the other group members’ ideal jobs. Based on all five group members and their ideal jobs, Jasmine’s ideal job as ‘Game Producer II (UI/UX)’ would rank the lowest when it comes to the demand rate from employers.
							</p>
							<b>What is the group’s required skill set (general and IT-specific)?
							</b>
							<b>General skills:</b>
							<ol>
								<li>Ability to collaborate/work in a team</li>
								<li>Possess strong communication and interpersonal skills</li>
								<li>Possess problem-solving skills</li>
								<li>Possess time management/organisational skills</li>
								<li>Ability to work alone</li>
								<li>Ability to adapt to new tools</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Combining all of the group members’ required skills and experience, it was noticed that there were many overlapping skills that were needed. General skills involved the ability to collaborate and work with team members, which linked heavily with possessing strong communication interpersonal skills. It is believed that the ideal jobs chosen are team focused and it requires being able to communicate effectively with team members and working towards a common goal with them, therefore it was highly prioritised as a required skill needed by most group members. The group members were also required to possess problem-solving skills, being able to think quickly when faced with an obstacle and being able to remain poised in a difficult situation that is affected by many factors, such as time constraints or pressure internally and externally, etc. Another general skill that was commonly found was time management (or organisational) skills, focusing on being able to meet deadlines and work while being on time with tasks. All these skills are tied together, creating cause and effect when approaching tasks or important projects. For example, group members need to be able to know how to work collaboratively through the use of communication, which will then help them achieve tasks by particular dates and deadlines. 
							</p>
							<b>IT specific skills:</b>
							<ol>
								<li>Programming language knowledge 
									<ul>
										<li>C++</li>
										<li>Python</li>
										<li>Java</li>
										<li>SQL</li>
										<li>Pillow</li>
										<li>Scala</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Software engineering</li>
								<li>Game or game content shipment</li>
								<li>Distributed development and outsourcing</li>
								<li>Figma</li>
								<li>Adobe Experience Manager</li>
								<li>Interface design and standards (Ideally in mobile gaming or digital entertainment)</li>
								<li>Web 2.0 technologies</li>
								<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
								<li>Photoshop</li>
								<li>Deep machine learning</li>
								<li>Cloud computing</li>
								<li>Vulnerabilities testing</li>
								<li>Networking (firewalls, routers, switches, network load balances)</li>
							</ol>
							<p>In terms of IT-specific skills, the skill that overlapped the most was to possess knowledge of using programming languages, in particular C++, Python or Java (other programming languages desired include SQL, Pillow and Scala). This is a strong indication of how programming languages are needed to create products and also allow for visions to come to life. Other than this, the required skill set ranges from many different aspects of technology. Some skills are more design and visualisation heavy such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, which are more concerned with how website and application interfaces will be presented. The skill set also branches out - from the distribution of games and shipping content, to software engineering, cloud computing, etc. 
							</p>
							<b>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </b>
							<p>The required skill set does not rank so highly in terms of demand from employers, however there is a particular skill that is a positive outlier which is SQL. This skill was classified under the programming languages that are desired to have knowledge of and it consistently ranks first in the Burning Glass data that has been provided. Compared to SQL, the other skills don’t rank as overwhelmingly high as SQL in the data. Some of the required skills rank in the mid-to-lower ranks of the data, while others are not listed in the top 25 skills ranked by Burning Glass. The skills that appear on the rankings are software engineering, Python and Adobe Photoshop - all three of these skills appeared in the bottom section of the rankings. The rest of the required skills in the set are not ranked in the data, which could be believed to be due to how specific the skills are to each group members’ ideal jobs, rather than more generalised and broader skills that can be used across many different types of jobs. 
							</p>
							<b>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </b>
							<p>The general skills that are in the group’s required skill set rank highly in terms of demand from employers. Looking at the provided Burning Glass data across 2017 to 2018, the highest ranking general skill that is in demand from employers is communication skills. The other skills include problem solving, organisational and teamwork/collaboration skills, meaning that combined, the group’s required skills are in high demand. Each of these skills has ranked in the top five of general skills in greatest demand according to the Burning Glass data, therefore it is important that the group is able to develop these skills to become desirable candidates to be selected for their ideal jobs.
							</p>
							<b>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? 
							</b>
							<p>The highest ranked three IT-specific skills are Javascript, Microsoft Windows and Microsoft C#. Javascript has ranked second consistently on the provided Burning Glass data. Javascript is a scripting language which has ranked high in the provided data, ranking 2nd place in all of the reports. Microsoft Windows has ranked between third and fourth in the Burning Glass data. This particular IT-specific skill means the ability to use the Windows operating system, having familiarity with it and can use the operating system with ease (referring to in terms of navigation and knowing what to do if there is an error). The ideal jobs did not state this in their requirements as there is the potential for employees to use a different operating system, for example, iOS (Apple) to perform their tasks. The third highest ranking skill was determined to be Microsoft C#, which had placed fairly high in terms of consistency compared to other skills. It is another programming language which uses elements of C++ and JAVA, which both already exist in the group’s skill set.
							</p>
							<b>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? 
							</b>
							<p>The top three general skills which are not in the group’s required skill set are writing, troubleshooting and planning. The group’s required skill set was fairly high in the Burning Glass data, which had remained consistent and similar throughout 2017 to 2018. However, ‘writing’ was noticed to be the higher ranking, being between __ and __ place on the provided Burning Glass reports. Troubleshooting and planning had ranked just after the group’s required general skills, however it was not specified by the companies of the group’s desired jobs, therefore were not considered required in the skill set. There were also particular skills that did not appear in the rankings (ability to work alone and ability to adapt to new tools). However overall, it has been presented that most of the required skills are desired and needed according to employers. 
							</p>
							<b>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
							</b>
							<p>The group had discussed this and they believe that they wouldn’t change their ideal jobs after looking and comparing the Burning Glass data. Overall, the group had agreed that they would prefer to do a job they have interest in and are passionate about, rather than to prioritise what is being sought out by employers. Several members also brought up that they feel that it will affect their mental health and work physique if they are in a job that is in high demand but not what they are interested in, which can heavily affect the output of their work when in the job. It was also discussed that due to all having an ideal job in the technology industry, there will always be demand from employers as technology is growing and developing at a rapid pace so employers would need people to help keep up to date and also ahead of their competitors.
							</p>
							<p>However, it is also important to acknowledge how looking at such data can influence one’s opinion on whether or not they want to pursue a career in their desired job. For example, Jasmine did see how her particular ideal job would not be as easily accessible and it could become a challenge for her to pursue due to the lack of demand in the industry. This can also affect how a person may approach their job search and determining what skills they should focus on developing to become a desirable candidate for their ideal job.

							<h2>IT work</h2>

							<p>For our section of IT work, we decided to interview a professional that has worked in the IT field for more than 3 years. The interview was arranged through a mutual contact from one of the group members and the interview was done via zoom. For the interview questions we went with ones that were provided to us through the interview guideline, but we also asked additional questions that we were curious about. All the questions that were asked and the answers gathered are provided below.
</p>

						<div class="content">
							<div class="inner">
								<b>1.  Could you please tell us a little about your work and the industry that you work in.</b>
								<p>‘I am currently working as a software engineer/ DevOps. Technically I'm working in the medical industry, but I am mostly working with clinical data and the IT side of it.</p>

								<b>2. Could you tell us a little about your educational background?</b>
								<p>‘I did my undergraduate in Bachelor of Science, majoring in computing and software systems from The University of Melbourne. Then I did masters of cybersecurity from Monash University, and I've been working for the last three and a half years now at The University of Melbourne.</p>

								<b>3. Could you briefly give us an insight about the industry that you work in.</b>
								<p>“Since I am between both clinical and IT industry, in that sense, I have to say that it's the job aspect is great at this stage. There's a huge number of opportunities because specially in Australia there is a shortage of people who are qualified and skilled to work at a senior level. when it comes to merging both clinical studies, clinical trials data, medical data and as well as software engineering and bringing them all together”. He further emphasized how it doesn’t matter what degree we have, if we are passionate about the IT field and can self-develop all the soft skills, you can break into it. So it largely depends upon how passionate or interested we are about this field. Our technical skills are basically tools that we can later apply to any industry that we want. Especially in 2022 where IT programming skills are used everywhere starting from banking, clinical research, machine learning, blockchain and even commerce or arts.</p>

								<b>4. What is your role and what tasks are you expected to do on a day-to-day basis?</b>
								<p>“I started off as IT support officer at The University of Melbourne, so I was working mostly in stroke research and managing the data that we receive on the day-to-day basis. Once we receive the data, we are required to clean it up, manage it, process it and then store it. We need to archive data sets and then we need to visualize or display the whole system for the clinician and researchers. My role initially was to manage and hold the data pipeline. Right now, it's mostly about managing the team that does all of this work. Furthermore, on the side we are developing internal tools, by using Python or Golang. These are the two languages that we use on a daily day-to-day basis to develop tools that can facilitate better clinical trials as that's what we aim to do. We basically float between both and try to merge them together as per need”. He further added that the industry that he is working in is more inclined towards the research aspect rather than the commercial aspect, so it has more flexibility than the general software development lifecycle that employees need to go through. But more work is required from the individuals’ side when it comes to figuring out how we want to put out the whole system in front of the stake holders or researchers.</p>
								
								<b>5. Who would you say are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</b>
								<p>“I need to interact with a large number of different people from different industries because as I am leading the team right now. 50% of my time goes into meetings at this stage. I need to work with clinicians directly because they are the stakeholders. I need to work with neurologist because my work is stroke research focus, and we need to work with nurses. We also need to work with trial nurses who are managing the data for stroke coordinators. From the IT perspective we must work with project managers, system analysts, system architect, and DevOps.” Currently he is working at a project called ACCSS where 28 universities around Australia are collaborating and coming together to build a more uniform system for the research community. In his current situation he needs to interact with academics, researchers, and different research groups. He further added how it gets taxing at times interacting with so many different people on a day-to-day basis.
								</p>

								<b>6. What aspect of your work do you spend the most time on?</b>
								<p>“I spend most of the time on setting up the basis research I am currently working on. Market analysis is a huge part of my job as well because I want to bring the industry standard into the clinical field. When we look into the IT implementation or software implementation in medical research, we are still way behind. For example, Google Health and Apple Health are leading the industry, whereas we, coming from an academic perspective are far behind. So recently a huge amount of time goes into meetings. But other than it also goes into market research and finding out what tools are out there in the industry that we can bring into the team to enable better research.”</p>

								<b>7. What aspect of your work do you find the most challenging and why so?</b>
								<p>“At this stage, post COVID, the most challenging part is doing all my meetings online. I have to stare at your computer 24/7, so there’s that. But in all seriousness, the most challenging would be convincing the clinicians to get on board with a particular idea. So, for example, if you are a doctor and you are using a certain instrument to do your research, or on a patient to improve their health, bringing a new product in at that stage. The most challenging part is putting on the description or presentation to convince them. In a sense I would say being the salesman in this team is the most challenging part. We need to convince a huge group of people from people working in IT all the way to clinicians.” What made this process he just explained all the more challenging is to do them online. Being present at a meeting in person is integral for building rapport and trust, so doing so on zoom made it even more difficult for his team. He further interjected that the best he could do at this stage is put up some nice slides to be convincing to his audience as doing presentations.
								</p>

								<b>8. Is there anything about your field that you wish was different?</b>
								<p>He believes there is still a huge room for improvement in order to facilitate faster prototyping and testing because there is a certain level of bureaucracy that he needs to go through as he is working in IT as well as the clinical field. So, if there was a way to streamline the barrier of bureaucracy in between, it would to make it faster to pass through the whole system. It would be a huge gain for the professionals in the industry as it would make the whole process a lot more efficient and less time consuming.</p>

								<b>9. Any advice you would like to give young IT professionals that are just starting out in this field?</b>
								<p>“As I said before, I don't think of technical skills like programming as something you need to learn by all means. Think of it as more of a tool that allows you to save time and to be more efficient in your work process. If you think you need to be pedantic and learn everything. that’s basically taxing on yourself and limiting your time. Think primarily about the process you want to be a part of and how can you approach it. Select your goal and be specific and work on your skills from that point onwards. So that that would be my two cents to new IT professionals and maybe reduce some of the worry that stems from needing to learn everything”. We further discussed upon how the most integral part is to be very specific about your goal and then building the skills required as per that requirement. Ambiguity can often times deter you from your learning graph and learning everything all at once is never realistic. That concluded our interview for the project.</p>

								<h1>IT Technologies</h1>

								<h2><u>Cryptocurrency</u></h2>

								<b>What does it do?</b>
								<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency which is secured by cryptography. Cryptography is associated with the process of converting normal plain text intro unintelligible text and vice versa. This technology makes it nearly impossible to forge money. Cryptocurrency is a network based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a digital ever growing list of data records. Blockchain.com is a cryptocurrency financial services company which began as the first bitcoin blockchain rambler in 2011. There are many types of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC),Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin(BCH), stellar(XLM) and many more.
								</p>
								<p>Many activities may be done with cryptocurrency, including low-cost money transfers, investing, earning interest, performing private transactions, sending no cash remittances, travelling the world, and purchasing automobiles. To make a purchase using Bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency, the customer must first obtain a crypto debit card. These cards are pre-loaded with the user's favourite cryptocurrency. The store receives fiat money as payment when the user spends the cryptocurrency. To guarantee that these transactions run smoothly, crypto debit cards are partnered with payment processing behemoths such as Visa or Mastercard. Extending the applications of cryptocurrencies
								</p>
								<p><b>Low cost money transfer: </b> Among other things, Bitcoin is famous for receiving and delivering large sums of money at a low cost and in a timely manner. For example, it would only take 10 minutes to transmit $1 million in bitcoins. And the sender would only pay roughly $0.20 in transaction costs.
								</p>
								<p><b>Investments: </b> due to the fact that the cryptocurrency values growth over time. Investing in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins or Litecoins may be quite profitable. In 2013, the overall market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency market was at $1.6 billion. It has risen to nearly $1.4 trillion by June 2021.
								</p>
								<p><b>Making private transactions: </b> one of the specialties of cryptocurrency is that it allows the users to make anonymous financial transactions such as Monero, Zcash. Therefore the individuals who use this type of currencies can make large transactions without having to explain to the bank why they are sending money or what the sources of the funds are or who they are sending it to. This reduces the unnecessary time delay for the transactions. 
								</p>
								<p><b>Travel the world: </b>during the past 10 years the cryptocurrency system has been growing unexplainably with technology.  Due to this reason it is easy and possible to travel with cryptocurrency. Morse successful and well used agents such as Expedia, AirBaltic, BTCtrip.com accept Bitcoin and Litecoin as a payment method to book hotels, flights, car rentals. 
								</p>
								<p>The value of cryptocurrencies has risen dramatically in comparison to a decade ago. In 2001, 10,000 bitcoins could purchase a customer a maximum of three burgers, but by 2022, those coins are worth more than half a million dollars. The value of these coins is not just economic, but also political and societal. Money is a human invention that derives its validity and worth from agreement and convention.  As a result of this, economists predict that by 2030, the worldwide cryptocurrency market would have tripled in size, reaching approximately $5 billion in value. Businesses and brands will find it difficult to ignore the increasing wave of cryptocurrency, regardless of whether they wish to invest in it. The power of cryptocurrency will potentially have an effect on world finance and politics.The term "financial technology" refers to technology and innovation aimed at competing with existing financial techniques for the delivery of financial services. And it's a popular profession since coders, digital users, software developers, entrepreneurs, and internet users are always looking for ways to better the way people do things. Users will begin to use cryptocurrencies after the community becomes more familiar with it (in terms of use, security, and functionality).
								</p>
								<p>Blockchain is the key technology that allows cryptocurrencies to exist. As previously stated, blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across peer-to-peer networks. Participants can confirm transactions on the blockchain without the requirement for a central clearing authority. Blockchain is a complicated technology with regulatory ramifications, yet it offers precise tracking, minimal costs, and high transparency.
									De Louvois, often known as the bitcoin luxury marketplace, is one of the most well-known markets for spending cryptocurrencies. This marketplace specialises in high-end vehicles such as Ferraris, Teslas, Lamborghinis, supercars, and motorcycles. Also available are jewellery, luxury real estate, and art. Cryptocurrencies are the only way to buy these items.
								</p>

								<b>What is the likely impact?</b>
								<p>Cryptocurrencies have a global economic and environmental impact. Despite the fact that bitcoin is based on technology, it has a large environmental effect. This is accomplished through bitcoin mining, which is the process of digitally validating and adding transactions to the blockchain record on the bitcoin network. The mining process is carried out with the use of advanced machinery that solves a difficult computational maths problem. The next bundle of bitcoins is given to the first computer to solve the challenge, and the process continues. 
									The value is estimated to be 204.5 Terawatt hours by bitcoin specialists. This equates to about 2.145 kilowatt hours of electricity every transaction, which is about the same amount of energy used by the typical American family for 80.23 days. Cryptocurrency mining is expected to demand more energy in the future. Technology advancements will almost certainly lead to a substantial increase in consumption. As a result of rising bitcoin prices, crypto networks require more electricity. Because bitcoin is still a young currency, it hasn't had a significant influence on the economy, but it has had an impact on some parts of business. Some areas, such as the job market, have been harmed since some developed enterprises rely largely on trading as a source of revenue. Another economic consequence comes from transparency, which is one of the key characteristics of cryptocurrencies, but it may also be a danger for a business. Because this money cannot be controlled by individuals, businesses, or governments, the possibility of fraud and corruption is reduced.
									</p>
								<p>As technology advances, the desire to interact with people all over the world is becoming more of a financial requirement, which traditional financial institutions cannot meet as effectively as cryptocurrencies. As a result, investors or entrepreneurs may help with possibilities to invest in and transport money across borders, reshaping global business processes in the process. 						
								</p>
								<p>Some sectors may be affected as a result of the growth of cryptocurrencies. Supply chain management, healthcare, finance, and, most notably, government are examples of industries. When it comes to supply chain management, the usage of blockchain allows users to fish for the information they need and reel in the correct answers every time. The use of blockchain technology can improve the privacy, security, and interoperability of medical records. Because it offers a peer-to-peer payment mechanism with great security and minimal costs, blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt financial infrastructures. Because no central authority is necessary, the user is not obligated to pay for one. Voter fraud can be eliminated with blockchain technology.Officials can tally votes with perfect precision using blockchain technology since each ID can only be linked to one vote. Due to the near-impossibility of fraud with block chain technology, it is not possible.
								</p>
								<p>The danger associated with bitcoin has spawned an entire industry dedicated to overseeing cryptocurrency exchanges all around the world. As a result, the work market is rapidly changing. The most in-demand professionals in the blockchain business have been software engineers and cyber security engineers. As the work environment has shifted in recent years, interest in these individuals has grown in tandem with technological advancements. As the world of cryptocurrency develops and legalises, worldwide investment and job creation in the industry is likely to increase.
								</p>

								<b>How will this affect you?</b>
								<p>Computer-generated coins will be the currency of the future, thus as a new generation, we must become accustomed to them. This new technology may be tough to use and earn, but it offers security benefits and other advantages for future usage. This will have an impact on how you spend money in your daily life. More boutiques like De Louvois will be built. And with payments, there will be a shift in money transactions. In my opinion, the security will be adequate, but the procedure will be tough to navigate for novice users with low technological experience. 
								</p>
								<p>As technology advances, bitcoin will go from a speculative cyber innovation to a viable money that can be utilised. This may not be a cause for me to change my life savings into this cryptocurrency just yet, but if you are one of the many people who haven't realised or given much consideration to cryptocurrencies, reachingsecing on it may be an eye opener to the many great and bad elements of this technology.
								</p>
								<p>Because my surroundings aren't as tech-savvy as I am. They will struggle to grasp the notion of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins and Litecoins. It will be tough for them to obtain the cash since it takes extensive algorithmic understanding. As a result, this new technology will have an effect on my environment.
								</p>

								<h2><u>Artificial Intelligence</u></h2>

								<b>What does it do?</b>
								<p>Artificial intelligence is a machine that uses a variety of technologies to perceive, comprehend, learn, and behave in the same way as humans do. These machines must be intelligent in the same way that humans are. Although certain AIs have been present for more than 50 years, increases in computer power and novel algorithms have resulted in huge AI breakthroughs in recent years. Artificial intelligence is classified into two types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow Ai is the fundamental image that we, as users, see in computers or technology. This form of machine intelligence is visible in the voice and language recognition capabilities of virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri. In self-driving cars' visual recognition systems. These are referred to as narrow AI because, unlike humans, these systems can only learn or be taught how to do specific activities. The other sort of artificial intelligence is general AI, which is the adaptive intelligence present in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly various jobs. Based on its gathered expertise, it can do a wide range of jobs such as applying cosmetics, developing a database full of data, or discussing a wide range of issues. To summarise, generic AI is more of what scientists are striving to achieve.
								</p>
								<p>Artificial intelligence can do a wide range of tasks. It can also be useful in a user's daily life. Many things in today's world are powered by I, such as:
								</p>
								<p><b>web search: </b> When users enter data into the gadget, it records information in order to provide users with appropriate search results on web sites.
								</p>
								<p><b>Digital personal assistants: </b> Phones and tablets employ AI to deliver services that are relevant and personalised to the user. Virtual assistants aid people by answering questions, making recommendations, and assisting them in their daily lives.
								</p>
								<p><b>Online shopping: </b> Again, as online searchers, artificial intelligence is utilised to deliver customised suggestions for consumers based on prior searches or purchases.</p>
								<p><b>Cars: </b> artificial intelligence can be used for cars with self driving cars which are not yet popular however this is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence for functions.
								</p>
								<p>Artificial intelligence is transforming and becoming increasingly significant in the technological industry. The advancement is critical for the future since AI is laying the groundwork for computer learning. Computers can now harness vast volumes of data and utilise their learned intelligence to make optimum judgments and discoveries in a fraction of the time that people can. There are some industries which are starting to invest in AI.  industries such as: </p>
								<p><b>Transportation: </b> despite the fact that developing them can take a decade or more One day, self-driving automobiles will transport the entire planet from one area to another.
								</p>
								<p><b>Manufacturing: </b> AI's area of expertise is robotics. To maintain equipment functioning properly, AI-powered robots operate alongside people to execute a restricted range of duties such as assembling, stacking, and analysing operations.
								</p>
								<p><b>Customer service: </b> Google is working on a human-like assistant that can make phone calls to schedule appointments at places like hair salons, restaurants, doctors' offices, and so on. The technology recognises context in addition to words.
								</p>
								<p><b>Education: </b> Artificial intelligence is used to digitise school or university texts. In addition, virtual tutors aid human teachers, and face analysis assesses students' emotions to help detect who is struggling or bored, allowing the experience to be tailored to their specific requirements.
								</p>
								<p><b>Healthcare: </b> Diseases are more quickly and reliably detected, medication discovery is sped up and simplified, virtual nursing assistants monitor patients, and big data analysis helps to provide a more customised patient experience in the comparably AI young industry of healthcare.</p>

								<b>Technologies:</b>
								<p><b>Visual recognition: </b> this is a method in which processing an image or video signal, with the scope of recognising patterns. Rarely identifying the different elements in an image. 
								</p>
								<p><b>Text recognition: </b> this is a method in which it recognises and identifies text in image formats. 
								</p>
								<p><b>Robotics: </b> whenever a system or robot shows signs of intelligence. Either mechanical or robotics software</p>
								<p><b>Machine learning: </b> this is a method which AIs that tries to get a system to learn and relate information the way a person would. In order to accommodate this, this uses algorithms that are able to detect patterns in previous data, being able to create future predictions, as well as new trends such as deep learning and its neural network algorithms. 
								</p>
								<p><b>Deep learning: </b> this is a learning system which is inspired by the functioning of the neural networks of the human brain to process information, with a very complex mathematical basis. 
								</p>
								<p><b>Cognitive intelligence: </b> This is a blend of visual recognition, sound, text comprehension, and machine learning to construct computers that can interpret and respond to information about human interaction.
								</p>
								
								<b>What is the likely impact?</b>
								<p>Artificial intelligence refers to a computer program's capacity to learn, think, and act like a person. This technology has the potential to have both a bad and beneficial influence on the globe. There are a few positive impacts to this.
									As it interacts with consumers, basic <b>digital assistance</b> is provided, reducing the requirement for human resources. This technology may also be utilised on websites to help people who are in need or who have a desire.
									The prospect of achieving accuracy with a higher degree of precision is <b>reduced if human error is reduced.</b> This is because computers do not make the same mistakes that humans do since they are properly designed. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes choices based on previously obtained data and a set of algorithms.
									</p>
								<p><b>Decisions are made faster</b> and activities are completed faster than a person. Humans will consider numerous elements, both emotionally and practically, when making a choice, whereas AI-powered robots will simply consider what has been programmed and will produce results more quickly.
								</p>	
								<p>There are certain drawbacks to this technology that might have a harmful influence on the globe. Such as 
									In the market, there is a loss of jobs. While artificial intelligence will produce a large number of employment, the majority of the people expects a net rise in the sector or that roughly the same number of jobs will be created to replace those that are being destroyed as AI advances. This has affected 120 million employees worldwide, who will need to keep and upgrade their skills in the next few years. Robots and computers have largely supplanted human labour in numerous nations, including Greece, Japan, Canada, and China. According to the data analysis, this development will necessitate modifications in training and education programmes in order to prepare the future workforce as well as existing industry personnel.
									
									</p>	
								<p>The development of artificial intelligence automations such as drones and robotic swarms may enable remote assaults or disease distribution via nanorobots. These possible dangers will necessitate changes in law enforcement and defence organisations.With the rapid advancement of technology, these technologies necessitate the modification of rules and regulations across various nations in order to allow for safe and effective worldwide contacts. Artificial intelligence activities and judgments in one nation might easily have a negative impact on other countries around the world.</p>
								<p>These kinds of impacts can have an influence on certain areas including finance, marketing, information technology, and healthcare. These sorts of technologies can boost the inventiveness and efficacy of many technologies by reducing errors and completing tasks more quickly.</p>	
								
								<b>How will this affect you?</b>
								<p>Personally, artificial intelligence and intelligent automation of normal procedures make it faster and simpler for me to do my everyday responsibilities, and they improve my performance in a variety of ways. This frees up time and energy for people to devote to creative and social endeavours.</p>

								<h2><u>Autonomous vehicle</u></h2>

								<b>What does it do? </b>
								<p>Autonomous vehicles are the way of the future for cars. What are they? It's simple, a car that drives itself. Autonomous vehicles are capable of sensing its own environment and driving without any passengers present. The Society of Automotive Engineers currently defines 6 levels of automated driving. Ranging from level 0 (Fully Manual) to level 6 (Fully Autonomous).
								</p>
								<p>So what is the difference between Autonomous, Automated and self-Driving? The SAE doesn't use the term autonomous. The reason being that autonomy implies abilities further than electromechanical only. A fully autonomous vehicle would technically be self aware and make decisions on its own. An autonomous vehicle could drive wherever it wanted to go, whether an Automated vehicle will only follow orders.
								</p>
								<p>Level 0, No automation. Manual control, the human controls all aspects of driving.
									Level 1, Driver assistance. This is where the car has the ability to control one aspect, for instance cruise control.
									Level 2, Partial automation. ADAS. Now the vehicle can perform actions like steering or accelerating.
									Level 3, Conditional Automation. It now has environmental detection capabilities, the car can do most of the driving tasks.
									Level 4, High automation. Now the vehicle can perform all the driving tasks under specific circumstances.
									Level 5, Full automation. The vehicle can perform every driving action under every condition.
									Autonomous cars work by relying ons ensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning and powerful processors to execute software. They create a map of their surroundings by using the many sensors around the different parts of the vehicle. Using radar sensors they monitor the position of nearby vehicles. Video cameras detect road signs, traffic lights, track other nearby vehicles and also track nearby pedestrians. Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) are sensors that use light to detect the distance between vehicles, detect road edges and identify lane markings. They do this by sending pulses of light that bounce off of surfaces. To detect roadside curbs and other vehicles while parking they use ultrasonic sensors in the wheels. To use all this information the car uses intricate software to process all the information. It then interprets the data to plot a path and then sends that information to the car's actuators. The actuators control the cars braking, acceleration and steering. The software has hard coded rules in place. These include obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modelling and object recognition, these are so the car will follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles.
									</p>
									<p>There are quite a few challenges that autonomous car development has to struggle with. So far there are no Level 5 cars available for the general public and we are still far away from these kinds of vehicles. LIDAR and RADAR have a few issues. One LIDAR is expensive and they are still trying to find the balance between range and resolution. There is the chance that if there were multiple autonomous cars on the road at once the LIDAR might interfere with another. Weather is another factor to take into account. If there is snow covering the road then suddenly lane dividers are gone. A big factor is artificial vs emotional intelligence. Humans have subtle ways of communicating with one another, a nod, eye contact. These are all ways to communicate with each other. Can an autonomous car be able to do this? No. 
									</p>

								<b>What is the likely impact?</b>
								<p>There are many benefits that full autonomous driving will bring to our society. The ability to have a car fully drive itself brings about so many possibilities that were once impossible. It will help the elderly people have independence, at a certain age elderly can't drive, whether that be from eye sight or health issues. Now with autonomous driving they can just plug in where they want to go and it will do all the work. The biggest benefit of autonomous vehicles is that it will dramatically reduce the CO2 emissions of cars. Climate experts have identified three trends that should be adopted, vehicle automation, ridesharing and vehicle electrification. They predict that by 2050 these “three revolutions in urban transportation” could: Reduce traffic congestion (30% fewer vehicles on the road). Cut transportation costs by 40%. Reduce urban CO2 emissions by 80% worldwide.
								</p>
								<p>Another massive benefit is the reduction in accidents as 94% of accidents are caused by human error. Annually globally there are roughly over 1.35 million road traffic deaths. These are the leading cause of death for people aged 5-29. 
									There will be a 10% improvement in fuel economy, Ohio University found that US drivers waste roughly 3.1 billion gallons of fuel in their latest study.
									</p>
									<p>According to KPMG they found that in the UK people would have a reduction of 40% in travel time due to no human error while driving. In the US autonomous cars are expected to save workers 80 billion hours lost due to commuting, which in turn would save the US economy $1.3 trillion dollars. Also KPMG found that the savings from a lower cost in insurance, running costs and parking would result in the consumers saving £5 billion
									</p>

								<b>How will this affect you?</b>
								<p>This will affect everyone globally because everybody drives cars. Short term effect is small. Most cars around the world are only at Level 0 to 1. Cars generally have cruise control but that is the extent to which they are Automated. Tesla, which is arguably the leading car company for self Driving cars,  is probably around level 4 to 5. Its self-driving has the ability for Navigation on autopilot, lane changing, parking, summon and traffic light and stop sign control. The reason I bring this up is because it is the most advanced car and its starting price is $63,900 AUD for a baseline model 3, then it is an extra $10,100 AUD for the autopilot features. This is very expensive, the average salary for an Australian adult is just over $60,000. Also there is the legislation for Autonomous driving. Currently it is in a grey area, there have been no official laws passed. 
									Long term effect is significant. The benefit for the environment is massive. By 2050 it is predicted to reduce CO2 emissions by 80%. With climate change being such a present issue this is a massive change that will benefit everyone. As these cars become more accessible financially so will insurance, car upkeep and parking. Imagine a world where you just let your car drive you to the place and then drive itself home, no more parking fees. Human error causes 94% of accidents, you know what doesnt have human error, self driving cars. It will make general life safer for us as we drive cars every single day. It is estimated that fatal and non fatal crash injuries will cost the world economy approximately $1.8 trillion dollars, from 2015 to 2030. Currently my grandparents are unable to properly drive themselves places, especially long distances, and when I grow older I won't face this problem. Automated Driving allows for the older generation to go anywhere they want. As a driver still on my learners permit I have experienced the struggle of learning how to drive but later no one will need to learn how to drive. So what happens? Is there a driving age? We currently have it at 16, you have to drive with someone with a full licence. So when we don't have to learn how to drive what's the regulations for being in the self -driving cars?
									</p>

								<h2><u>Unreal Engine 5</u></h2>

								<b>What does it do? </b>
								<p>Unreal engine is a video game engine made by Epic Games. Introduced in 1998 through a first person shooter game “Unreal”. Originally it was made with first person shooters in mind but it was adopted for a variety of genres in 3D environments. Lately the film industry has been taking advantage of the engine for their environments, most notably being “The Mandalorian”. </p>
								<p>Engines are a tool for developers to create and manipulate the visuals, sounds, physics and other aspects of a 3D project. In the past developers had to use multiple programs to create a game, one for sound, another for animations etc. Game engines have now streamlined this process by combining multiple of these actions into one place.</p>
								<p>Unreal engine 5 is the latest generation of the engine. It is the most capable engine to date. It combines high end graphics and visual design while bringing audio, lighting and animations all in the one space. The biggest achievement That unreal engine 5 has achieved is the improved graphical fidelity. They’ve done this by removing the need for the developers to separately define how an object is lit. By substituting a universal lighting engine. Also, the level of detail visible, by dynamically scaling down the highest fidelity model. Lumen is the new fully dynamic indirect lighting pipeline. It allows for the scene geometry, material, and light properties to change at any time. Allowing for artists’ workflow to improve. It occurs in real time so there is no wait for the build times to get the final lighting quality. Additionally, Lumen-lit scenes need no reflection cubemaps, a collection of six square textures that represent the reflections on an environment, as Lumen completely replaces other methods and is able to render geometrically precise reflections. Another new capability of UE5 is “Nanite”. A new virtualized geometry system which uses a new internal mesh format and rendering technology to render pixel scale detail and high object counts. It intelligently does work on only the details that can be perceived and nothing else. The data format is highly compressed and supports fine-grained streaming with an automatic level of detail. 
								</p>
								<p>The advantages of nanite include:
								</p>
								    <ul>
										<li>Multiple orders of magnitude increase in geometry complexity, higher triangle and objects counts than has been possible before in real-time</li>
										<li>Frame budgets are no longer constrained by polycounts, draw calls, and mesh memory usage</li>
										<li>Now possible to directly import film-quality source arts, such as ZBrush sculpts and photogrammetry scans</li>
										<li>Use high-poly detailing rather than baking detail into normal map textures</li>
										<li>Level of Detail (LOD) is automatically handled and no longer requires manual setup for individual mesh's LODs</li>
										<li>Loss of quality is rare or non-existent, especially with LOD transitions</li>
									</ul>
								<p>MetaHuman Creator is a cloud-streamed app that allows you to create lifelike NPC’s in your video games. It takes real-time digital human creation and reduces the time crunch from weeks or even months all the way down to less than an hour. The models come fully rigged and ready to animate in Unreal Engine, reducing the modelors job. The User Interface has been simplified massively so that you don’t need to be an expert at 3D models to use it. It derives its data from real-world scans of people, which limits the user in creating models that are physically plausible. This Program allows for big studios or smaller indie studios to utilise believable quality models as their NPC’s without needed expert knowledge in modelling. 
								</p>
								<p>Unreal Engine  has already been used in filmmaking for virtual sets, most notably on The show “The Mandalorian”. It uses real time Computer generated Images being projected onto screens in the background of the sets. The beauty of this instead of greenscreen is that it is all real time. What this means is that the actors and film crew can see what's happening with the cgi elements while filming. Also with it being real time, the director himself can change the CGI like the environment as they please. 
								</p>

								<b>What is the likely impact?</b>
								<p>The impact on the gaming world will be big. With the additions of these two main features of lumin and nanite, video games are going to skyrocket in quality. Video games such as “elden ring” are already visually stunning but with UE5 they will become life-like. Imagine a horror game where all the light sources are from you, “amnesia the dark descent” with dynamic lighting. 
								</p>
								<p>Unreal Engine 5 will allow indie developers to compete with the big studios. The features like MetaHuman Creator gives small studios the ability to produce AAA quality content without the amount of resources AAA companies have. Also they have waived the royalty fee for projects that don’t make over a million dollars, further allowing indie developers to succeed.
								</p>
								<p>Unreal Engine is already having a major impact with the film industry but with the success of shows like “The Mandalorian” and more recently “The Batman”. Some people in the film industry hate using green screens. Sir Ian McKellen once broke down crying due to the constant use of green screen in “The Hobbit” saying “This is not why I became an actor.” Unreal Engine now takes the green aspect away from green screens as it projects the CGI in real time. Jon Favreau said on the set for ''The Mandalorian'',  “Let's start designing sets around what this could do well.” Another pro for using these screens and Unreal Engine for films is that it allows the physical actors to interact with CGI characters seamlessly. No more Tennis balls to guide where to look; they can be staring at the screen and seeing the character with their own two eyes. Also lighting, many films with greenscreen you can tell when the lighting is off, it is very hard to replicate lighting. Green screens reflect green light, the virtual set screens don’t. They project what the proper lighting should look like. Having virtual sets also reduce the total costs of production, no travel costs, and no massive sets to build.
								</p>

								<b>How will this affect you?</b>
								<p>This will affect the general population with seeing an increase of quality in both the gaming and film industries. As this continues to develop we will see tremendous growth in visual fidelity to a point where we won’t know the difference between real life and what's CGI. A small but notable difference will potentially be an increase in performances in actors. Now that they can truly see the vision directors have with CGi while acting they can get more into the feel of the movie and their characters. We will see an increase in high standards in the Indie field for both industries as all these tools are now readily available.
									It will affect me specifically because my passion is to become a game developer, and I will most likely be using Unreal Engine for my own projects in the future. So it is very exciting to see this become so readily available and accessible to everyone.

									<h1>Project idea</h1>
									<b>Chosen project idea:</b> <p> Nafisa’s app which acts as an aid for people who struggle to stay focused when studying.
									</p>

									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>For the longest time my phone has always been scattered with various productivity/focusing apps, to-do listing apps, habit trackers and applications that detect my screen time. Being a person with ADHD, I am always forgetful, disorganised, highly distracted, and have a poor sense of time. They have been things that have always affected my academics and also my personal life. These apps are things that help me gain control of my life even if it’s to a small degree. But I have noticed there are no apps in the market that are specifically targeted towards individuals with ADHD. Sure, there are a lot of apps like I mentioned above, but not one all-encompassing app that had all the features and more and was created specifically with a neurodivergent person in mind. That is exactly what I plan to do with my project this time. Creating an app for people like me that suffer with their daily tasks due to their ADHD.
									</p>

									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>Till date, it is known that there are 366.33 million affected adults globally. Furthermore, around 1 in every 20 Australians has ADHD. More than 3 in 4 children diagnosed with ADHD continue to experience the symptoms into adulthood. Most people likely go undiagnosed all their lives according to psychologists. This has made me believe that there is a viable market for this application. Having an elder sibling with a higher spectrum of ADHD also made me realise, even though it's something that cannot be cured, their lives can be drastically improved by building consistent habits and having a routine. I want to help people gain control of their own lives again with this application of mine.
									</p>

									<h3>Description</h3>
									<b>To do listing based on priority</b>
									<p>Before starting the day, we can add a to-do list and after writing all the content, we can select the priority of each task by numbering them on the priority list. For example, if we finish a task that was on top of our list and priority, we get more points than if we finished something at the bottom of the list. The total point being 10. This system of adding points in my opinion would add a sense of achievement for the users instead of just ticking them off the list.
									</p>

									<b>Virtual study rooms</b>
									<p>We can create our own study/ work group or choose to be added to others’ groups. Once we enter the group it will show us all the existing members there and how many hours they worked or studied for that day. The clock restarts each day after 1am for everyone. If someone is studying with us at that moment, their usernames will glow, and their stopwatch will run. Usernames that are dimmed or not glowing means that person is currently on a break. The people in each group are arranged based on how many hours they worked that day. And as your number on the clock goes up, you are put higher on the panel. Once you start the clock there you can’t access any other apps unless you exit the application entirely, in which case the clock stops running. As people with ADHD and just a lot of people in general have a poor sense of time, this feature would help them be accountable and give them feedback on how much work they did.
									</p>

									<b>Pomodoro timers (25/50)</b>
									<p>The application also allows a 25 minute and 50-minute pomodoro timer for people that like to work in such time blocks. For the 25-minute timer you get a break for 5 minutes after every 25 minute and a break of 10 minute after every 50 minute block. Then the timer starts again for the beginning unless you stop it from doing so.
									</p>

									<b>Reminders</b>
									<p>The application gives you reminders throughout the day, based on the undone tasks on the to-do list which shows in the notification bar. This will greatly help people with ADHD that are highly forgetful of everything.
									</p>

									<b>White noise
									</b>
									<p>A feature that allows you to play white noise in the background while using the application. Many people concentrate better when there is some kind of background noise, so I am interested in adding this feature as well. It will supply audios like rain, waves crashing, sound of mountain chimes, or even sounds of burning firewood.</p>

									<b>Haptic feedback</b>
									<p>Mostly two senses are used by electronic gadgets to connect with us: sight and hearing. By mimicking the feeling of touch, haptic feedback alters this. You can not only touch a computer or other equipment, but it can also touch you. Our goal for integrating this into our application is to create a feature where users can use the phone screen as a fidgeting tool when they feel anxious, restless or just stressed out in general. We want to first give our users a selection of visual cues for the type of fidgeting tool they would like to use e.g (Fidget spinner, fidget cubes, pop bubble fidget etc). After the selection process they can use the tool they selected similar to that of a real life one. It would mimic the sounds such as the clicking or popping of these tools and simulate the touch experience according to the tool being used. Furthermore, Adding haptic feedback has been shown to increase consumer engagement significantly.
									</p>

									<h3>Tools and technologies required
									</h3>
									<p><b>X code IDE</b> is required to build our application using swift. <b>Swift</b> is a programming language we are going to need in order to build the logic of our application. <b>Swift UI</b> is also needed for the UI framework of our program. It makes it easy for us to build the application step by step. Furthermore, we need to be registered with <b>App store</b>
								          in order for us to distribute the application by joining the developer program. When we register for the developer program, we gain access to <b>Test flight</b> for beta testing and for receiving bug reports on our program. <b>Proto</b> or <b>Figma</b> can be used to design the wireframes or mock ups.</p>

									<h3>Skills required</h3>
									<p>For the successful creation of this application, the most important skill required is programming skills. We could also use an app-builder if we do not want to do it from scratch. Another integral skill required is being able to study the market space for maximum exposure of our product. For this we might have to come up with a feasible marketing plan. Lastly, design skills are also required for us to design an application that’s user friendly and to get the basic feel of the application during the creation process. High level of design skills are not required as there are a lot of websites, like I mentioned above, that allow us to do this with ease.
									</p>	
									
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>My biggest hope to bring with this application is a sense of belonging and community for people. The market might be small as there is a lack of awareness for ADHD and many people that go undiagnosed. But for the most part I believe it would help the users be more organised and gain more control of their lives, be more productive and focus more on the task at hand. Here’s to creating an application that I always wished existed.

							<p>I entered this group not knowing a single person here yet all of them welcomed me immediately. Initially I thought I could be a bit awkward as I was the only guy in the group but they were really nice. We all bonded over common interests like anime or games and I believe this helped us work well together. Everyone communicated really well – there was no arguing over anything and everyone was very accomodating of each other. What could have been improved was that there was a member who wasn't very present at the beginning, we found out it was due mostly to personal reasons. This wasn’t a huge deal in the end but at the start it was a bit worrying. What surprised me was how smoothly we have all worked together. Like I previously stated there were no conflicts. As the only guy I thought I would feel a bit excluded but that never happened. What I have learned about group work is two things. One, if you spend the time to get to know the members outside of university things you will work better together. Two, communication is key. If there are days of dead silence and people are just assuming everyone is working and contributing, that won’t work well. We messaged each other at least every two days, not just about the work either. 
							</p>

							<b><u>Jasmine-</u></b>
							<p>Coming into this assignment, I was quite worried and nervous because I felt like I hadn’t properly gotten to know my group members that well – but we found quite a few common interests. However, the group has been such a welcoming and easy-going group to work with, everyone knows their responsibilities and are always willing to help each other. I felt like everyone had a similar workflow and we were able to work well together without coming across any major obstacles that could have heavily affected the pace of our work. The group is great at problem solving and making sure that everyone has a part in the process, also that no one is taking on more workload than others. One thing that was surprising was how well the group was able to keep on time, while still working at a more easy-going and steady pace – if we fell slightly behind, we were able to quickly catch up as if we were never behind in the first place. Something that could have been improved is being more efficient at communication as we would come across some minor miscommunications – this is something we’ll definitely improve on for the next assignment. 
							</p>

							<b><u>Sudari-</u></b>
							<p>When the group first gathered, we were unsure about the task and were unsure about the task and were terrified when we saw all of the previous work. However at the end of the week, the work came together seamlessly as a result of everyone's hard work. We as a group assigned each section to a different person, with a deadline for completion. If someone has an issue, they could communicate about it at the meetings, or they can split their workload if they feel they are doing too much. During the group meeting, the members were straightforward and organised about the content that needed to be covered in that amount of time. There was just one glitch, which was one group member not being present during class or meetings due to personal reasons. However, at the end, the group members had spoken about their difficulty and had been able to resolve it.The group shared a Google document where everyone could input their work. Throughout the first couple of weeks, the document remained empty, but by the second last week, everything was coming together really smoothly, with everyone adding finished work into the document and fulfilling all of the tasks flawlessly. The group members expressed any challenges they encountered and requested for assistance when required to enable the group to fulfil the job quickly.
							</p>

							<b><u>Nafisa-</u></b>
							<p>I believe our group as a whole has worked very cohesively and everyone contributed to their parts well without any kind of miscommunication or conflicts. The meetings were attended on their scheduled times and the attendance was well on behalf of all the members. We faced a little difficulty reaching out to a member while working on the assignment. So I definitely think the communication channels could be improved. I believe it would have been better if we had our contact numbers as not everyone is always active online or doesn't prefer being online on messaging apps. However, we were fairly surprised how well the project went. Everyone did their parts well and were straight to the point. We definitely expected to come across more hurdles than we did. So the smooth process was pleasantly surprising. Upon completion of this assignment, it really taught me the importance of having team members that are communicative and easy to get along with. It really made the entire process less taxing and simple. It further taught me to be honest to my team members if a task gets too work heavy or complicated, so it can be solved together.
							</p>

							<b><u>Amulya-</u></b>
							<p>
								The group project was the most exciting learning experience. I worked with people I had never worked with before. Anyway, I couldn’t participate or communicate a lot because of personal reasons. I didn’t talk enough with the team members, which made it hard for me to follow up, but my team members were helpful to me. We discussed and distributed the tasks, and each started working on their task. We communicated through the social platform, discord for easy and fast communication, and scheduled meetings. We used google documents to gather all the information and what we discussed in the team's meeting. The biggest challenge was planning team meetings because everyone was preoccupied with personal work, but we delivered and completed the tasks on time. On the whole, I am delighted with the quality of work we produced, and as a whole, we worked in harmony. 
							</p>

							<b><u>Group-</u></b>
							<p>As a group, we were able to find agreement with how many factors we have been able to do well. One of the biggest factors was how we were able to work well as a team – this was due to every group members’ willingness to take initiative.  Each group member was made aware of their responsibility and how their efforts can help contribute to the team. Another factor that stood out was how the group members were always willing to help each other. There were many instances when a group member would express that they need some help with their section, and there will always be someone who would be willing to help because they have already completed their task. We were also able to inform each other of what we were doing, and everyone considered each others’ personal lives and were very understanding when there was someone who was unable to attend a meeting. 
							</p>
							<p>There are a few factors that we need to improve on, which we will definitely work on in the future. One of the main factors was communication as there was a time towards the beginning of the assignment where it was a bit hard to reach out to group members. It would have also been more convenient to hold more meetings, but it was not as ideal with everyone having different schedules. Also, one of the group members was unable to be there in class with the rest of the group due to personal reasons, which was a shame but through efforts of trying to reach out to them, we were able to make it work and it also gave them time to make up for what they did miss.
							</p>
							<p>What we found surprising was how well we worked together, we were able to stay on task and didn’t allow ourselves to fall behind too much. There were no major hiccups that could have affected the pacing of our work, as well as the synergy of the group. Everyone was very open to ideas and were willing to help to expand them, as well as give new suggestions. We had quickly learned that everyone is able to work well if they are able to understand and share the same vision for the assignment, as well as being open to new opinions and ideas as it helped to progress the group’s work even more.
